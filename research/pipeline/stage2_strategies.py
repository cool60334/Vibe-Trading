Stage-2 runner: Strategy Generation.

Per symbol in research_config.yaml this runner:
  1. Reads research/manifests/factor_<symbol>.json (stage-1 output) and selects
     only factors whose verdict is NOT ``reject``.
  2. Builds a Vibe-Trading swarm invocation, injecting the selected-factor JSON
     as decision context.
  3. Invokes ``vibe-trading --swarm-run crypto_trading_desk`` via subprocess.
  4. Writes, per generated strategy:
       - research/strategies/strategy_<id>.yaml   (the strategy spec)
       - research/manifests/<id>/generation.json  (stage-2 handoff)

Then verifies all outputs and exits non-zero on any failure.

Usage
-----
    # From repo root:
    python -m research.pipeline.stage2_strategies

    # From research/ directory (preferred):
    python -m pipeline.stage2_strategies

    # Direct script invocation:
    python research/pipeline/stage2_strategies.py

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
DESIGN NOTES — the two genuinely under-specified decisions, made explicit.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

(A) HOW UPSTREAM JSON IS INJECTED.
    The ``crypto_trading_desk`` preset (agent/src/swarm/presets/...) declares
    exactly two variables — ``target`` and ``timeframe``. There is NO external
    decision-context channel:
      * ``{upstream_context}`` is filled ONLY from inter-agent ``input_from``
        task dependencies (agent/src/swarm/worker.py — build_worker_prompt does
        ``system_prompt.replace("{upstream_context}", upstream_block)`` where
        upstream_block comes from *previous agents*, not external input).
      * Only the task ``prompt_template`` gets ``user_vars`` substituted, via
        ``format_map`` (worker.py:320). Extra keys are silently tolerated by
        a fallback dict but never rendered because the preset templates do not
        reference them.
    Adding a real injection channel would require editing the preset or the
    worker — both forbidden (``agent/`` is off-limits).
    DECISION: inject the selected-factor JSON by appending it to the value of
    the ``timeframe`` variable. ``timeframe`` is free-form prose that DOES flow
    into a prompt_template, so the swarm's first-layer agents see it. We do NOT
    pack it into ``target`` because ``target`` is regex-scanned by the swarm's
    grounding layer (agent/src/swarm/grounding.py) and must stay a clean
    ``BASE-USDT`` token. The factor manifest for one symbol is small (a handful
    of factors, four horizons each — well under 1 KB of JSON), so the FULL JSON
    is injected, not a digest. The design Open Question ("full JSON vs digest,
    by token count") is therefore resolved in favour of full JSON.

(B) SWARM PROSE -> STRATEGY YAML.
    The swarm produces PROSE desk analysis (a trading plan in markdown). It
    does NOT natively emit a strategy YAML, and it cannot be told our exact
    YAML schema without editing the preset prompts (forbidden). Relying on the
    swarm's ``write_file`` tool to drop a schema-correct YAML is not viable:
    workers write to per-agent artifact dirs, the preset prompts hard-force a
    ``report.md`` deliverable, and there is no channel to communicate the
    target schema.
    DECISION: the runner OWNS the structured strategy spec. It deterministically
    synthesises a valid strategy YAML *scaffold* from the stage-1 factor
    manifest (the same schema as research/strategies/strategy_S*.yaml), and
    attaches the swarm's prose desk analysis as the rationale / hypothesis.
    The swarm's contribution is recorded as ``generation.rationale`` (Tier-3
    audit prose, per design D-tiers — "not evidence, post-hoc rationalisation")
    and the swarm run id as ``generation.source_run``.
    LIMITATION (explicit): the YAML's quantitative thresholds (percentiles,
    hold periods, parameter-search ranges) are a defensible scaffold derived
    from the factor verdicts and the conventions in the existing S1-S4 files —
    they are NOT authored by the LLM. A faithful LLM-authored spec would
    require an ``agent/`` change (e.g. a new preset variable + a structured
    output contract). This is called out in the stage report.
